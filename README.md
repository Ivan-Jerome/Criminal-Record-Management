# Criminal Record Management

Criminal records serve multiple purposes, including identification of suspects in unsolved cases and background checks for employment. These records begin with an arrest, where personal information is recorded and stored alongside the arrest details. In the past, these records were kept in handwritten or typed files at local police stations, but now they are stored in massive computer databases that are easily accessible worldwide. This advancement has made it easier for law enforcement agencies to keep a detailed record of an individual's criminal history.
